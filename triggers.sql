/* *****************Story of Triggers in SQL****************        

    *******About myselfâ€¦***********
1. Triggers are database objects that are designed to automatically execute a set of SQL statements or code when a specific event occurs within the database. 
2. These events can include actions like inserting, updating, or deleting rows in a table. 
3. Triggers are used to enforce business rules, maintain data integrity, and automate certain database tasks.
   
   
    ******Components of Triggers*******
1. Event: This defines the database action that triggers the execution of the trigger. 
          The events can be categorized into three main types:
        a. BEFORE: Triggered before the specified event occurs 
           (e.g., before an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation).
        b. AFTER: Triggered after the specified event occurs.
        c. INSTEAD OF: This type of trigger is used for views, allowing you to replace the default action with a custom action.
2. Action: This is the set of SQL statements or code that will be executed when the trigger is fired due to the specified event.
